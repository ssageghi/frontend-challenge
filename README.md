# Front-End Challenge

## Challenge Description

Implement [ Github's trending ](https://github.com/trending) page using the
[ Github-Trending-API ](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/Github-Trending-API).
Make sure all Javascript code is written in TypeScript and covered by tests.

## Required Features:

- Trending repositories with spoken language, language, and date filters
- Trending developers with language and date filters
- Redirect all links (e.g. developers, repositories) to an accurate page on
  Github

## Technical Requirements:

- Write clean code. We code for humans, not machines.
- Ensure that the source code has type checking by writing it in Typescript.
- Ensure that your code is well-tested and reliable.
- User interface accuracy. Your implementation must visually be the same as
  Github's designs.
- You are also responsible for project structure and source code organization.
- We will examine your git workflow and commit history as well. Use clean and
  descriptive commit messages and branch names.
- Performant code is mandatory.
- Adhering to accessibility guidelines is highly regarded. (optional)

## Tools And Technologies:

You may use any library, framework, or technology as long as you meet the
requirements. Be aware that you are responsible for the bundle size,
performance, complexity, and structure of the project. So make wise decisions.
Here are some of the tools already installed in the project boilerplate and some
recommendations:

- The project utilizes [ PNPM ](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.
- The project is created and powered by [ Vite ](https://vitejs.dev/).
- The Typescript is installed and configured, but you can update `tsconfig.json`
  as you need.
- [ Jest ](https://jestjs.io/),
  [ React Testing Library ](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/),
  and [ jest-dom ](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) are already
  installed and configured in the project. You can update configurations as you
  need.
- You are free to use any CSS libraries or techniques. Our recommendation is
  Utility-First libraries such as [ WindiCss ](https://windicss.org/) or
  [ TailwindCss ](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- The project also contains lightweight configurations of
  [ Eslint ](https://eslint.org/) and [ Prettier ](https://prettier.io/) for
  code formatting. You can update the configuration as needed.
- To create consistent commit messages, we recommend using the
  [ Conventional Commits ](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) guidelines.
- You can optionally host your project online. Check out the
  [ Vite documentation ](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) to learn
  more.

Good luck.
